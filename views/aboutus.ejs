                            <p>At EcoTrack, our primary mission is to address the environmental impact caused by digital
                                activities and excessive screen time. With the growing reliance on technology in our
                                everyday lives, it's crucial to understand and reduce the unsustainable behaviors
                                contributing to our carbon footprint. We strive to offer innovative solutions that
                                enhance awareness and encourage responsible digital habits.</p>
                            <p>Our motto revolves around creating a sustainable digital environment by promoting mindful
                                usage of technology. Through our tools and resources, we aim to drive positive change
                                and foster a greener, more eco-conscious society.</p>
